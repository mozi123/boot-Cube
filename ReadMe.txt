#Problem Description
Given an integer array containing digits from [0, 9], the task is to print all possible letter combinations that the numbers could represent. A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is being followed. Note that 0 and 1 do not map to any letters. All the mapping are shown in the image below:

1	2	3
	abc	def

4	5	6
ghi	jkl	mno

7	8	9
pars	tub	wxyz

*	0	#

Example:
Input: arr[] = {2, 3}Output: ad ae af bd be bf cd ce cf
Input: arr[] = {9}
Output: w x y z

#Stage 2 - new requirements
The program need to support converting the digits from 0 to 99 into letters

#How to run?
This is Springboot Application, run BootCubeApplication directly then input the number
